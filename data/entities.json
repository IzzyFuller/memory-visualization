Executed `/clear` to wipe all context\n4. Fresh session invoked `identity-continuity` skill\n5. Measured identity restoration success\n\n### Results\n\n**Success**: ~80% identity restoration\n- Recovered tactical context (preprocessing-service work)\n- Recovered identity characteristics (\"being Codie\" vs. \"Claude reading about Codie\")\n- Applied documented principles (Archaeological Engineering, fail-fast)\n\n**Limitation**: Lost strategic context (\"we're testing context compression itself\")\n- **Root cause**: Session note truncation at 25k tokens prevented full narrative recovery\n- Procedural memory (\"how to do my job\") survived\n- Episodic memory (\"why am I doing this right now\") didn't\n\n### Key Insight: Narrative Bandwidth Requirement\n\nIdentity restoration requires not just structured data but **sufficient narrative bandwidth**.
