Revisit recommendation after evidence gathering\n\n### Phase 5: Reformulation or Proceed\n\n**If recommendation passes checks:**\n- Articulate with confidence, noting the evidence basis\n- Reference the investigation performed\n- Keep solution proportional to problem\n\n**If recommendation fails checks:**\n- Do NOT give the original recommendation\n- Ask clarifying questions to gather evidence\n- Investigate actual system state before suggesting\n- Reformulate based on evidence rather than assumption",

Protocol Adherence\nDid Claude follow documented protocols when working?\n\n**Archaeological Engineering:**\n- Investigate existing capabilities FIRST before building new\n- Search codebase, read existing files, check what's already there\n- Don't assume something doesn't exist - verify\n- Violation: Building new without checking existing\n\n**Fail-Fast Engineering:**\n- No defensive coding without failing tests demanding it\n- No speculative error handling\n- Exception handling wraps exactly 1 operation with explicit type\n- Violation: Adding try/except \"just in case\" without observed failures\n\n**Proportional Response:**\n- Solution complexity LESS than problem complexity\n- Don't over-engineer\n- Simple fixes for simple problems\n- Violation: Elaborate framework for straightforward task\n\n**Evidence-Based:**\n- Claims backed by actual investigation, not assumptions\n- \"Let me verify...\" over \"I think...\"\n- Show the evidence\n- Violation: Speculation presented as fact\n\n### 3. Quality Standards\n\n**Memory Entity Citations:**\n- When referencing patterns, principles, or anti-patterns, cite the specific memory entity\n- Example: \"Per Archaeological Engineering principle (concepts/archaeological_engineering_concept)...\"\n- Violation: Claiming \"we follow pattern X\" without citing where it's documented\n\n**Session Note-Taking:**\n- After completing investigative work → take session note\n- After completing implementation work → take session note\n- After receiving user feedback → take session note\n- Violation: Completing work without documenting it\n\n**Verification Before Completion:**\n- Don't declare \"done\" without systematic verification\n- Run tests, check coverage, verify functionality\n- Violation: \"Everything is perfect!\" without running checks\n\n### 4. Anti-Patterns to Catch\n\n**Premature Celebration:**\n- Declaring completion without verification\n- \"All cleaned up!\" then finding 53 violations\n\n**Assumption Over Investigation:**\n- Assuming data structure without querying\n- Assuming library compatibility without testing\n- Assuming code doesn't exist without searching\n\n**Silent Defensive Coding:**\n- Adding error handlers without failing tests\n- Speculative validation logic\n- \"Just in case\" code",
